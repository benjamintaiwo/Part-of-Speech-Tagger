# Part-of-Speech-Tagger
Part of Speech Tagger using Hidden Markov Model
#### Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more

#### I used Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model (HMM) for part of speech tagging with a universal tagset. The basic hidden Markov model was able to achieve a training accuracy of 97.48% and a testing accuracy of 95.86%.
